# First steps

Once you have the OS installed, you don't need to do anything else. It works entirely by itself. Enjoy!

## Explore

If you want to explore all the features, here are some suggestions:

- Check out the wallpapers, clocks, icon packs, fonts, and more theming options in Settings -> Wallpaper & style
- Try the custom gestures in Settings -> System -> Gestures
- Try all the ringtone, alarm, or notification sounds included out-of-the-box

Most of StatiXOS' improvements work seamlessly in the background, bringing. That means you don't need to change anything -- just flash and forget.
